## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
-I read a lot, have always deepened my understanding of something when teaching others what I have learned and I definitely put growth at the top of my priority list. I recently went vegan and stopped drinking and immediately noticed a huge increase in clarity and energy. I wouldn't necessarily say I did it for my brain, but it was a side effect.
-I need to start scheduling breaks (especially when frustration sets in).
-I would add "find creative ways to keep yourself accountable". One of my favorites is setting high goals and telling as many people as possible. It makes consequences for not following through.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
-Strings - anything in "quotes" words, phrases, even numbers.
-Booleans - True/false, Yes/No. Choices that can be used to shift direction.
-Numbers - Numbers not in quotes, no commas.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// To note what you are doing, pseudocode an outline, etc. without affecting the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A question(name) and an answer(value) to store(with keyword) information for reference later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Orbitz-
-location (string)
-numberOfPassengers (number)
-checkLuggage (Boolean)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
-A way to join data together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Greetings- console.log("Welcome back," + name);

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
-How do these simple commands and assignments become super complicated sites and algorithms?
