## Section 4 Reflection

### 1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* I think I got more total hours of work in, and a lot more productive time at that. The breaks were refreshing and kept me from feeling like a zombie staring at my computer for too long.

#### 2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* Everything was a lot fresher, clearer and more exciting. Pom technique definitely had a lot to do with that, but part of the feeling definitely came from becoming more comfortable and knowledgeable with the material. Hard to decipher how much was from one or the other. Time definitely moved faster though and I had a great time learning, so either way. A win, win.

#### 3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An object is a way to store more complex data more efficiently. Not dis-similar to an array, but more useful and modifiable than an array. Arrays can also be used inside of an object.

#### 4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  * An `array` is all that is needed if only a list of student names is needed.


  * List of states and their capitals
  * An `object` would be better because there is more than one type of data variable for each item.


  * List of things to pack for vacation
  * `Array` should be sufficient for a basic list of items.


  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  * An `array` would work for a list of accounts. An object could work better if you wanted to assign other variables (name of account, type of content, verified, etc.)


  * List of student names and their cohort
  * An `Object` would allow better for name, (cohort, (and if wanted) pronouns, location, etc.


  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  * Object once again because you would want to organize ingredient and amount in a more efficiently modifiable format than am array.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  Again, an `array` would work, but I would prefer an `object` so I could also include location, type of food, vegan options, outdoor seating, etc.

#### 5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* Spotify Playlist would have a `transaction item object` for each song added with (artist, song title, album, date added and length).


#### 6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
* I would like to know how to more efficiently access arrayed items stored inside classes using position numbers.
