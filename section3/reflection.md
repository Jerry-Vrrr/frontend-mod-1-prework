## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* <b>Seeking out changes</b> really resonated with me. Back in my early snowboarding days, I used to get excited on days when I didn't fall once! I soon realized that this was only slightly because i had gotten better but mostly because I had stopped pushing myself. I immediately gave myself a new objective: To fall at least 10 times per day, so make sure I was challenging myself. I have adopted that to everything i do, especially in learning.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* As stated above, I always challenge myself to get out of my learning comfort zone.
* I do _not_ always seek out help when I should, but I will from now on.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* On Spotify: An array of songs in an artist's catalogue.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* Secondary commands that allow you to manipulate data inside of an array.  


5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

### A loop is a more effective method of repeating a certain task a certain number of times.

* Loops can be used in conjunction with arrays to perform an action different values of data stored in an array.

* Loops used without an array would be used for simpler repeated actions.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

### I would explain it using an everyday repeated action, like brushing your teeth.
#### <b>I would ask:<b/>
  * How do you brush your teeth and who taught <i>you</i> how?
* Tell the child I don't know how and ask them to teach me.
* Have them list the steps and number of times you brush each area.
* I would explain that like me, a computer doesn't know how to do simple repetitive things.
* If we don't tell the computer how to brush it's teeth, it can't do it.
* If we don't tell it when to stop, it will brush it's teeth forever and ever.
* If we don't tell it to brush for long enough, the computer will have dirty teeth and stinky breath.
* Wait for giggles to stop and then explain that we use loops to tell the computer how long is should brush it's teeth. And other more computery things.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* How to add files to arrays and use them practically.
