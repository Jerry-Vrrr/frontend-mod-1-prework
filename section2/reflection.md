## Section 2 Reflection

### 1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
-I am not afraid to ask questions, but I have had a slight inclination to ask too soon. I have definitely felt silly after asking a question too soon and then realizing that the answer was right under my nose. I love the set of guidelines in asking questions. Takes the guesswork out.

###1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
-Felt great! It forced me to dig into my recent memory and pull those skills to the forefront re-inforcing those skills instead of re-inforing that the information will always be spoonfed.

###1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
-```if, if else and else``` statements that can sort data to find the best place to categorize or send it.

An example in daily like might be:
-```If``` there is coffee in the house, make coffee.
-```Else if``` there is no coffee in the house 'and' you have money, buy coffee.
-```Else``` drink tea.

An example on the web might be:
'A website for a distillery or brewery.'
-You are given a prompt to <b>Enter your DOB</b>.
-```If``` born on or before this date 21 years prior, you are given access to the full site.
-```Else```, you are redirected to a message stating that you must be 21 years of age or older to enjoy this site. 

###1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
Data is gathered.
If data fits condition1, "A" will log. If not, will move to condition2 to see if the data fits those parameters. If it does, "B" will log. If not, repeat with contition(3,4,5,etc.) until data fits the parameters. If no parameters are met, an else statement can be triggered.

###1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?  
Logical Operators ```&&``` - ```||```.
The "and" and "or" operators.

###1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
What are some of the biggest and craziest things we can do with them? Are some arguments absurdly long or
are complicated sites full of a lot of smaller arguments?
